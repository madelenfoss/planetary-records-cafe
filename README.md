# planetary records cafe

This project is a caf√© and vinyl shop concept to showcase everything we have learnt during the year of studying frontend development at Fagskolen Kristiania 22/23.

MVP - Minimum Viable Product:

Mobile and desktop version.
Vinyl shop with vinyl data fetched from Sanity.
Filter buttons to sort vinyls by genre, and the possibility 
to click on each vinyl item to open a new page with more info.
Make sure everything is accessible.

Extra: 
A simplified shopping cart, with the possibility to add 
products and see the items in the cart when hovering with 
the cursor on desktop version, and when clicking on mobile version.

What I will do next:
Create a javascript file called fetchData.js to fetch all data from Sanity.io and then get the data needed for each function in the project from that file.
