# planetary records cafe

This project is a caf√© and vinyl shop concept to show what we have learnt during the year of studying frontend development at Fagskolen Kristiania 22/23.

MVP - Minimum Viable Product:

Mobile and desktop version.
Vinyl shop with vinyl data fetched from Sanity.
Filter buttons to sort vinyls by genre, and the possibility 
to click on each vinyl item to open a new page with more info.
There will also be a simplified shopping cart, with the
possibility to add products and see the items in the cart when hovering
with the cursor on desktop version, and when clicking on mobile version.
Make sure everything is accessible.
