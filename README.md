What I will do next:
Create a javascript file called fetchData.js to fetch all data from Sanity.io, and then get the data needed for each function that will be used in the project from the fetchData file.

Add try catch the right way.

Make all 'buy' and 'add to cart' buttons work with the shoppingCart function - including filtered vinyls.
Add local storage to keep items in cart.

Connect slideshow button dots to slideshow slides in javascript.

Add preview to Sanity schemas.
