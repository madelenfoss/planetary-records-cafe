Good week with good workflow. Still missing some pieces in figma, but 
on track. 

Sprint 2:
Sanity will be used as database.
Start working on project in VScode, create mockup-pages to see how to render
and append elements from javascript files.

Another effective week. Created website structure and mockups. 
Added more elements/pages not mentioned in sprint 2, but it goes
well with the theme.

Sprint 3:
Fetch data from Sanity. Create vinyl shop with data fetched from Sanity.

but did not have time to create shop cart properly.

Sprint 4:
Create slideshow for main page with images fetched from Sanity.
Create about page with staff info fetched from Sanity.

Sprint 4:
Created slideshow with images fetched from Sanity. Had some trouble with ghost

to get the right data. 

Sprint 5:
Make sure everything looks and works as it should, create comments and todos if
something needs to be fixed at a later point.

Finished the simplified shopping cart. Checked indentation, comments, made sure
all pieces are where they should be.
